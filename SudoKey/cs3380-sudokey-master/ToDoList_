0. make app

- Leo has created a great starting code to build upon, good job homie!

While giving it a look I made some comments explaining what things do(understanding code and making it easier to navigate)
I also added some comments with future methods we should think about implementing. 

I'll list the things on the top of the to do list here

1. how to populate board? (DONE)
  a. need another class that either contains arrays for game sets or imports game sets from an external txt file 
  b. controller should have a variable that stores the random game set as a two dim array

  ~since then~
  Sudokey is looking pretty good
  - added new GUI that makes the game look prettier
  - added ability to input from the keyboard
  - added ability to undo

  Works in progress()
  - timer
  - wrong answer counter


 2. Some things that should be added pretty soon(before final code submission)
   a. A button that starts the game
   b. A timer that keeps track of how long the application has been open
   c. A text that keeps track of how many errors you make
   d. a message that pops up notifying the user when the game is complete
   e. a restart/new game option
   f. maybe adjusting button/grid to window size
